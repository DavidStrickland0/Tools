Collection of various tools I created and have here for others to grab if they want them. 
They are mostly just 5 minute hack jubs to overcome a specific issue.

Nunit Test Finder-Commandline interface that will search through a directory or directory tree and find all the Nunit test assemblies in the tree. These are then writen into a generatedconfig.nunit file intended for use with OpenCover. This is designed so that you dont have to keep updating a central solution every time a new test project is created.

Open Cover Threshholds- Commandline app intended to fail a build if the CCP, Branch or sequence coverage is beyond a certain threshhold.
